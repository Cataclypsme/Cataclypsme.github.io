My name is Said Habou Adi and I have a passion for technology, especially Web3. I'm a Bilingual(English-French) Content Specialist with experience in technical writing, technical content translation, copywriting, MTPE, subtitling, Screenwriting, SEO and Linkbuilding. I have a good working knowledge of Solidity in addition to HTML, Markdown, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Analytics, Java and REST APIs.

I am interested in open-source projects, Web3 projects, REST APIs, Content Management Software, and docs-as-code projects. I had developed a demographic app for the National Statistic Institue of my country in 2014 and I had translated Web3 development courses on Coursera a few years ago. Also, I have published technical content on some well-known websites. I strongly believe that Web3 has a bright future due to its philosophy, and I'd like to contribute to its success and help millions of people adopt it.

If you are looking for a technical writer with a new approach to technical writing or a technical translator who understands Microsoft Writing Style Guide and Microsoft Translation Guide, please don't hesitate to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/said-habou-adi-309091111/ "Said Habou Adi's Linkedin profile").
