Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains of the web3 space. Ethereum is a **public database** constantly updated and shared across multiple computers called **nodes**. It's made up of entities that hold balances. These entities are called **accounts**, and they can transfer and receive funds. Ethereum Blockchain features **user accounts** and **smart contracts accounts**, which are programs stored on it.

The main programming language for developing Ethereum smart contracts and DApps is **Solidity**. In this guide, I will walk you through the steps of building a simple smart contract to ensure you've got the fundamentals of smart contracts development. This guide is intended for people with no experience in programming and web3 as well as readers with working knowledge of other programming languages.

In this tutorial, I will only use **Remix IDE**. Indeed using **Remix IDE** does not require you to install any additional program on your computer for the completion of the below instructions.

## About Remix IDE

**Remix** is a browser-based IDE for developing Ethereum codes or smart contracts. **IDE** stands for Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is a developer-friendly code editor that detects errors in codes and makes the programming tasks easier. I will use it to create our Ethereum smart contract. 

To use **Remix IDE**, just visit <https://remix.ethereum.org/>. Once you load Remix's website, you will see Remix's UI as shown in the following image:

<img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/remixHome.png" alt="Remix's Interface">

Remix's interface features the following: 

**A. Main Panel:** Lists some useful shurtcuts and opens up an editor whenever a file is selected or created in the File explorers. It also features a menu tab corresponding to files selected in the File explorer.

**B. Terminal:** Provides you with information on transactions. Transactions are requests for code executions in the web3 vocabulary. You can also use your terminal for running scripts.

**C. Side Panel:** Acts as a graphical place-holder that shows text fields and dropdown lists of the highlighted plugin in the Icon Bar. For example, if you click on the File explorer icon in the top-left corner, the Side Panel will live update with workspaces drop-down list, projects' folders and files.

**D. Icons Bar:** located on the far left-hand side, it lists all the icons of the plugins you activated, the Plugins Manager and the Settings.

## Building, Compiling and Deploying Smart Contracts Using Remix

A solidity smart contract consists of one or multiple files with `.sol` extension that encapsulates a set of state variables, and functions. The **EVM**, Ethereum Virtual Machine, is in charge of executing solidity codes. But before executing them, it requires an **EVM bytecode** generated by compiling `.sol` files with the Solidity compiler. Then the bytecode is sent to the Ethereum network as a deployment transaction to be interpreted by the EVM. As a reminder, a transaction is a request for codes execution.

The deployed smart contract resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain doing nothing. It executes the codes only if an external account calls its functions. It then computes new valid states of the blockchain. The following sections will cover building, compiling and deploying smart contracts. 

### Building a Smart Contract Using Remix

To create a smart contract:

<img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/remix2.png" alt="Creating a smart contract">

1. Go to the Icon Bar.
2. Click on File explorers icon.
3. Right-click on `contracts` folder.
4. Click on **New** ***>*** **File**.
5. Name your file `simplecontract.sol`, `simplecontract` is the file name, and `.sol` the extension specifying the programming language encapsulated in the file. An empathy code editor will live-update the Main Panel and a tab with your new file's name.
6. Copy the below code by excluding the numbered list and paste it into your Remix's code editor:
{% highlight solidity linenos %}
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8;

contract SimpleContract {

    // variables
    uint balance;

    // Functions
    function getBalance() public view returns(uint) {
        return balance;
    }
    function addBalance(uint _balance) public {
        balance = balance + _balance;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}  


***Note:*** You can go to [compiling a smart contract](#compiling-a-smart-contract-using-remix) section if you're familiar with Solidity basics or other programming languages. But if you are coding for the first time, you may read these explanations. 

The first line of our code specifies that the source code is licensed under MIT. Machine-readable license specifiers are important for open-source projects development.

The next line shows the Solidity version the source code is written for. Pragmas tell compilers how to treat the source code for stability. There are two syntaxes for specifying the solidity compiler version: pragma solidity `^version` and pragma solidity `min version` up to, excluding `max version`. As e.g,

{% highlight solidity %}
pragma solidity ^0.8; or pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0; 
{% endhighlight %}

The contract statement on the fourth line is used in all solidity source codes. It marks the beginning of a solidity code. Following this statement are state variables and functions. A first letter of a Contracts' names is always capitalized, and contracts are declared as follows:  
{% highlight solidity %}
    contract Contractname { 
        ...
    }
{% endhighlight %}

In the body of the contract encapsulates comments. Using them organizes your codes so to simplify the revision. The comments statement consists of two forward slashes followed by a comment. As e.g,  

    // yourcomment
        ...codes

The line `uint balance;` declares a state variable called the balance of type uint (unsigned integer of 256 bits). A state variable is data permanently stored on the blockchain. It consists of a data type it stores(uint in this example, a name (balance) and a value that we have not initialized yet. It's recommended to capitalize the first letter of words following the first word of a variable's name.  
A variable is declared and initialized as follows:

        type_of_variable varibaleName = value;

The code contains the two functions associated with most state variables: a setter function and a getter function. A function is a set of instructions for executing a precise task. A setter is a function that set or modifies the value of a variable, and a getter is a function that only retrieves the value of a variable.   
You declare a function as follows:
{% highlight solidity %}

function functionName(_parameters) public/private {
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

If the function reads the variable, here's how to declare it:
{% highlight solidity %}
function functionName() public view returns (type_Of_Variable_to_return) {
    return variable;
}

{% endhighlight %}

### Compiling a Smart Contract Using Remix

Upon the completion of the previous instructions, you must now compile your smart contract. As a reminder, the EVM only reads EVM bytecodes. Compiling smart contracts generates these bytecodes.  
To compile a smart contract:

<img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/remix3.png" alt="A smart contract compilation">

1. Go to the Icon Bar
2. Click on the Solidity compiler icon. The Side-panel will update with functionalities that you can configure. In this tutorial, we won't change anything.
3. Click the below large blue Compile button with your contract's name to compile it. This will autogenerate three additional buttons below your contract dropdown list. The buttons include: **Publish on Ipfs**, **Publish on Swarm**, and **Compilation Details** buttons.

Clicking on one of the first two buttons will publish your code to either IPFS or Swarm off-chain network, meanwhile clicking on the **Compilation Details** button will display detailed information on your code. IPFS and Swarm are alternatives blockchain used in combination with the Ethereum blockchain for storing data and files. This tutorial will not cover distributed storages.

### Deploying a Smart Contract Using Remix

After compiling a smart contract, the next task is to send the EVM bytecode to the Blockchain, a network of computers. In this tutorial I will not use a mainnet(Ethereum blockchain) or a testnet(Ethereum blockchain simulator). I will use a browser-based blockchain called JavaScript VM, which stands for Virtual Machine. To deploy your compiled code:

<img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/remixDeploy1.png" alt="Deploying a smart contract">


1. Click on Deploy & Run transactions Icon.
2. Set your deployment configurations. This will enables you to select your blockchain and switch ethereum accounts...
3. Click on Deploy. The terminal will display the transaction details and the amount of ether you own in your selected account will be debited. That's because it costs some ethers to deploy a smart contract.

    <img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/Terminal1.png" alt="Terminal showing transactions results">

4. Scroll down and click on the angle-bracket under deployed so it expands to show autogenerated buttons as shown in this image.

    <img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/remixDeploy2.png" alt="Screenshot of a Deployed smart contract">

As a reminder I have declared these two functions in our source code as follows:
    {% highlight solidity%}
        ....
    // Functions
    function addBalance(uint _balance) public {
        balance = balance + _balance;
    }
    function getBalance() public view returns(uint) {
        return balance;
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

In the next section on Interacting with smart contracts, I will provide you with further explanations of the auto-generated buttons, the meaning of their colors, and how to interact with smart contracts.

## Interacting with Your Contract Using Remix IDE

Let's interact with our smart contract. To Interact with a contract whenever you deployed it:

<img src="/assets/web3/contractsforbeginners/Interaction.png" alt="Functions buttons screenshot">

1. Click on the angle bracket so it expands to show buttons that represent your contract functions.
2. Click on getBalance to retrieve the value of the variable named balance. Whenever you make a call to a smart contract, the transaction results is displayed in the terminal as shown in the image above. 
3. Enter the desired value in the text field associated with addBalance function and click its button.

Functions, which do not create a new transaction, such as constant or pure functions in Solidity have blue buttons. They do not cause state changes. They only return a value stored in the contract and they does not cost you anything in gas fees.

Functions that cause state changes and that do not accept Ether are called non-payable functions and have an orange button. Clicking on them will cost gas fees.

Functions that have red buttons are payable functions in Solidity. Clicking one of these will create a new transaction. In fact it will debit the account you are using and credit another one. The value of a payable function is put in the Value field which is under the Gas Limit field.

To see a more detailed information on your transaction, click on its blue **debug** button in the terminal.  
The button will expands to display information similar as shown in the following image.

## Conclusion

That's it. You've now got the basics of Ethereum development and you can now use Remix IDE for developing smart contracts, compiling them, deploying them, and interacting with them. To master Solidity you need to keep improving your skills. In later articles I will cover **NFTs** and **DAOs**.
